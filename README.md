# CLaSSiC2.5

## Installation Guide
### Github installation
Easiest way to get CLaSSiC is to git clone from this repository.
*  Install GIT from: https://git-scm.com/downloads 
*  Go to the folder you want to clone to
*  Git clone https://github.com/NBI-Magnetism-Group/CLaSSiC2.5.git

### C++ Setup
To run CLaSSiC a C++ enviroment is needed.
* Install MSYS2 from: https://www.msys2.org/
* Add the path to system variables "C:\msys64\mingw64\bin" 

### Code editor
To run CLaSSiC a code editor is needed that both can run python and C++.
Personal preference is Visual Studio Code, which then needs the following extensions:
* C/C++
* python
* pylance
* github: pull requests and issues

### Python Enviroment
To run the plotting tools in the simulator a pyhton enviroment is needed.

Packages needed:
* pyfftw
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy


### Task.json structure
When everything is download and located on your computer and all the above steps are complete. Then open the 'run.bash' and press "ctrl/command"+"shift"+"b" to create the 'task.json' file.

If this returns an error, then in the root of CLaSSiC folder, create '.vscode' and in that folder create a 'tasks.json' file.

Else the 'tasks.json' file needs to contain:

```
{
  "version":"2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
			"type": "cppbuild",
			"label": "release",
			"command": "C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/g++.exe",
			"args": [
				"-fdiagnostics-color=always",
				"-O3",
				"'Your location to CLaSSiC'/CLaSSiC2.0/CLaSSiC2.0/*.cpp",
				"-o",
				"'Your location to CLaSSiC'/CLaSSiC2.0/CLaSSiC2.0/model.out",
				"-std=c++17",
				"-mavx2",
				"-march=native"
			],
			"problemMatcher": ["$gcc"],
			"group": {
				"kind": "build",
				"isDefault": true
			},
			"detail": "compiler: C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/g++.exe"
		},
}
```

## Guide to run CLaSSiC
With the 'tasks.json' set-up and the enviroments running, then open the 'run.bash' and press "ctrl/command"+"shift"+"b" to run the 'task.json' file and this should make the 'model.out' file.
With this file created, CLaSSiC is ready to run.


To run CLaSSiC, you specify the struture and variables in the 'run.bash' file and then to compute the simultaion you "cd 'Location of run.bash'" in the terminal and run the command "bash run.bash".
